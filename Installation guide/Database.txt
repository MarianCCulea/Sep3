Step 1. Create a schema and set it.

CREATE SCHEMA sepdb;
SET SCHEMA 'sepdb';

Step 2. Create the tables in this order.



CREATE TABLE orders

CREATE TABLE item(

  price Float NOT NULL CHECK(price > 0),
  description Text NOT NULL,
  url VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL ,
  quantity int NOT NULL ,
  quantitytype varchar NOT NULL CHECK(quantitytype IN ('ml', 'mg','mg/ml')),
  nrofitems int default 0
  );


CREATE TABLE OrderhasItems(
  order_id   int,
  item_id  int,
  item_count int,
 PRIMARY KEY (order_id, item_id)
, FOREIGN KEY (item_id) REFERENCES item(id)

);

 CREATE TABLE Userhasorder(
  user_id   int,
  order_id  INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, order_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

Mechanism of action: Pyrantel and febantel act synergistically against coilworm, hookworm and whipworm. Pyrantel provides spastic paralysis of roundworm via depolarizing neuromuscular blockade. Febantel inhibits the polymerization of tubulin to microtubulin, providing a structural and functional metabolic disorder that depletes the parasites energy reserves and kills it within 2-3 days. Prazikvantel is very rapidly absorbed through the parasites surface and damages the integument, causing interrupted metabolism and then death.',
